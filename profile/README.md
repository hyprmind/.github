# Hyprmind

### Decentralized AI Compute. Trust-Minimized Agents. Verifiable Autonomy.

Hyprmind is a decentralized AI compute network built on HyperEVM.  
GPU miners provide low-cost, verifiable inference; users and intelligent agents pay for compute in USDT; and network revenue is continuously used to buy back $MIND — forming a simple, direct, and economically sustainable loop.

Hyprmind enables **open, uncensored, permissionless AI**, giving developers, creators, and autonomous agents the ability to run models or build intelligent systems without any centralized control or policy restrictions.

## 🧠 What Hyprmind Is

Hyprmind is a **distributed GPU network** where:

- **Miners** provide compute, stake $MIND, and earn emissions  
- **Users** pay in USDT for AI inference  
- **The protocol** uses revenue to buy back $MIND  
- **Builders** deploy models, agents, and applications trustlessly  
- **Inference** is verifiable through TEE attestation + proof-of-compute  
- **Content policies** do not exist — builders define their own rules  

The network is designed to be a simple, resilient, and permissionless substrate for AI.

## 🕸️ Hyprmind Network — Core Layer

A global marketplace of GPU miners grouped into **Hardware Clusters**, each offering predictable pricing and performance based on the underlying metal.

### Economic Loop

1. Users & applications pay for AI inference in **USDT**.  
2. GPU miners earn **$MIND emissions** for providing compute.  
3. All network revenue is used to **systematically buy back $MIND**.  
4. Miners stake $MIND to join; builders pair with $MIND to launch agents.  
5. This creates **natural token sinks**, making $MIND structurally deflationary.

### Properties

- Low-cost, verifiable inference  
- No gatekeepers or censorship  
- Hardware-backed economic value  
- Permissionless deployment of models, agents, and workloads

## 🧪 Zoomer Quants — Testing Ground for Hyprmind Concepts

Zoomer Quants is not a pillar of the network — it's a **stepping-stone project** used to validate:

- sovereign agent execution  
- TEE-secured signing flows  
- multi-process LLM runtime design  
- containerized agent behavior  
- on-chain metadata evolution  
- end-to-end economic loops for autonomous agents  

The agents run:

- 13B–20B class LLMs  
- deterministic Hyperliquid trading engines  
- TEE-secured signature endpoints  
- multi-process reasoning + log streaming  
- ERC-721 identity with evolving metadata  

Zoomer Quants demonstrates the kind of **trust-minimized autonomous agents** developers will be able to build on Hyprmind.

## 🔓 Why Hyprmind Exists

Centralized AI clouds impose:

- opaque moderation  
- unverifiable compute  
- inconsistent pricing  
- fragile single points of failure
- Heavy biases

Hyprmind provides the opposite:

### Open & Uncensored
Anyone can deploy models or agents with any personality or content policy, including fully unrestricted behavior.

### Trust-Minimized
Inference is validated using TEE attestation and proof-of-compute mechanisms.

### Permissionless
No applications, approvals, or gatekeepers.

### Economically Simple
Pay in USDT → miners earn $MIND → revenue buys back $MIND.

## 🧬 Use Cases

- **DeFi:** tamper-proof bots, audit-ready execution logs  
- **Onchain Agents:** autonomous systems that acquire and pay for compute  
- **DeSci:** reproducible scientific workloads (protein folding, large models)  
- **Oracle Infrastructure:** AI summarizing public data into high-integrity feeds  
- **Unrestricted AI Models:** NSFW, edgy, experimental, or alternative personalities  
- **Agent & Model Launchpad:** permissionless business models around intelligent agents

## 🧭 Principles

- Minimize trust wherever possible  
- Prefer reproducibility over convenience  
- Agents should outlive the developers  
- Fail loudly instead of silently  
- Hardware, not policy, defines the boundary
